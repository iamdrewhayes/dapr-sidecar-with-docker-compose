Dapr Sidecar with docker-compose
This reference project is to show how you can use docker-compose to run a Dapr sidecar along with your API. Check out the [blog post](https://www.drewhayes.dev/blog/dapr-sidecar-with-docker-compose/) that goes with this repo.

The project itself doesn't do anything - it's the out of the box .NET Web API with the weather forecast controller.
